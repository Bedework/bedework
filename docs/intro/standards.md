# Calendaring Standards & Interoperability
The Bedework implementation team participates in the standards process as a member of [CalConnect, the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium](http://www.calconnect.org/), which is "focused on the interoperable exchange of calendaring and scheduling information between dissimilar programs, platforms, and technologies."

Interoperability with other calendar systems and clients by way of standards compliance is an important design goal of the Bedework system.

Bedework is designed to conform to existing calendar standards. In particular:

  * iCalendar: [RFC 5545](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)<br/>
    Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification
  * iTIP: [RFC 5546](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5546)<br/>
    iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol
  * CalDAV: [RFC 4791](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)<br/>
    Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV
  * CalDAV scheduling [RFC6638](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6638)<br/>
    Scheduling Extensions to CalDAV
  * CardDAV [RFC6352](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6352)<br/>
    vCard Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning
  * [VPOLL](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-york-vpoll-04): Consensus Scheduling Component for iCalendar
