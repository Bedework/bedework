=== Issues

    * Modifying a recurring event so that it is not recurring will leave instances indexed.

    * CalintfHelper.getCollection returns null - causes failures higher up.

    * Index waits and refresh could be set to only occur on testing if there is any real performance issue. Generally - in real life - the delay isn't a problem.

    * Should I be removing the entity from entity caches in the indexer?
