=== Calendaring Standards & Interoperability
The Bedework implementation team participates in the standards process as a member of http://www.calconnect.org/[CalConnect, the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium], which is "focused on the interoperable exchange of calendaring and scheduling information between dissimilar programs, platforms, and technologies."

Interoperability with other calendar systems and clients by way of standards compliance is an important design goal of the Bedework system.

Bedework is designed to conform to existing calendar standards. For more information about calendaring and calendaring standards, please visit https://devguide.calconnect.org/Appendix/Standards/[the CalConnect Devguide].
