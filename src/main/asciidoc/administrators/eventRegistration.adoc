=== Public Events Registration

Bedework supports a public events registration system that allows authenticated users to register for events. Users may view and modify their registrations, such as unregistering or changing the number of tickets they've requested. When registration is full, users may choose to be placed on a waiting list. Users on waiting lists will automatically be moved up in the queue if space becomes available.

With the form elements as shown below, administrators can specify how many users may register, how many tickets each registrant may request, and set the opening and closing dates of registration. Administrators can view and modify a registration list and download CSV files of their registrations on-demand.

==== Displaying the current status
Clicking on the "View registrations" button will take you to a screen showing the current registrations for the event. This screen also allows the administrator to hold some tickets and to update or remove registrations.

==== Custom Fields
Administrators may add custom field elements for use during registration. These custom fields are displayed to the user when they register for the event. These fields can be used to obtain extra information from the user as they register, for example dietary restrictions.

Currently the results are only visible in the downloaded registrations. 

==== Data elements
Data about the event is maintained in x-properties attached to the event and provides the following information:

  * Booking window start and end
  * Number of tickets
  * Max number of tickets per person
