==== Indexer errors
The following error might be seen when attempting to make changes to any indexed object:
----
AuthorizationException(403, 'cluster_block_exception', 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];')
----

The indexes have been made read-only - this can happen if, for example, the file system becomes full.

The indexes may be unlocked by doing the following

----
curl -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:9200/_all/_settings -d '{"index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null}'
----
