=== Adding a topical area.

==== First create a category for the topical area.
Or categories if necessary. The normal case is to filter and categorise with the same category.

Go to system/manage-categories and add any required new category or categories.

==== Create a system alias.
Go to system/Manage calendars & folders and determine where in the hierarchy you want the topical area to appear.

Create a new subscription, set the system name, display name and
description and set the category or categories for auto-tagging and
filtering and select "Subscription".

Set the url to bwcal:///public/cals/MainCal - ensure all other fields
are blank and add the alias.

Using system aliases in this way ensures consistency in categorisation.

==== Create a subscription to the new alias.
If the new alias is in a folder it may already by available.

Otherwise switch to the "Calendar Suite" tab.
Select "Manage Subscriptions" and open up the top level folder (named the same as the suite)...
